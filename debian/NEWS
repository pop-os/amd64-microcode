amd64-microcode (3.20230808.1) unstable; urgency=high

    This release requires *either* new-enough system firmware, *or* a
    recent-enough Linux kernel to properly work on AMD Genoa and Bergamo
    processors.

    The firmware requirement is AGESA 1.0.0.8 or newer.

    The Linux kernel requirement is a group of patches that are already
    present in the Linux stable/LTS trees since versions: v4.19.289,
    v5.4.250, v5.10.187, v5.15.120, v6.1.37, v6.3.11 and v6.4.1.  These
    patches are also present in Linux v6.5-rc1.

amd64-microcode (2.20141028.1) unstable; urgency=medium

    This release drops support for automatically applying microcode updates
    without a reboot.  The microcode updates can still be applied without a
    reboot through manual action of the system administrator.

    This is a defensive measure.  At this time, there are no reported
    issues caused by the AMD microcode update itself when done outside of
    the boot process.

    However, updating only on boot works around a very elusive issue in
    the Linux kernel microcode update driver for AMD processors, which
    may or may not have been fixed in the latest stable/long-term
    kernels.

    It is now possible to configure how the amd64-microcode package should
    behave through the /etc/default/amd64-microcode file.  By default, it
    will install microcode update support to the initramfs only when
    running in a system with an AMD processor.
