Description: Processor microcode firmware for AMD CPUs
 The microcode data file for Linux contains the latest microcode
 definitions for all AMD AMD64 processors.  AMD releases microcode
 updates to correct processor behavior as documented in the
 respective processor revision guides.  While the regular
 approach to getting this microcode update is via a BIOS upgrade,
 AMD realizes that this is an administrative hassle; the Linux
 Operating System has a mechanism to update the microcode after
 booting the OS.
 .
 For Intel processors, please refer to the intel-microcode package.
