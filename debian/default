# Set this to "no" to disable automatic microcode updates on boot;
# Set this to "yes" to always install microcode updates to the initramfs;
# Set this to "auto" to use initramfs mode automatically (default);
#
# Note: "early" mode is not yet supported in amd64-microcode version 2.
# It will be implemented in version 3, at which point "yes" will alias
# to "early", and only "early microcode updates" will be supported.
